= Introduction =

This is a non-binding list of things I would like to get done in this emulator, and a summary of the status of each new work item.


= Emulation =

General - Frame skipping, partial drawing
        - state saving is broken -- fix it
             - rewind feature 

CPU timing - double check timing values in cpu definition XML

PPU - fix splitscreen draw code
    - PAL emulation
    - 'out of process' rendering mode (port queueing + data offloaded to fragment shader in opengl)
    - create fork for unsafe code
          - videobuffer as fixed buffer, pass ptr to display
          - ptr arithmetic in BumpScanline, FetchNextTile, GetNameTablePixel, GetSpritePixel

APU - fix interrupts (broke when port queueing implemented)
    - PCM channel
    - allow shared buffer to be of arbitrary size, rather than 1 per frame
    - unsafe blipper 

Carts - 

= Platform =


Common - finish up debugger viewmodels, including fixing breakpoint support
       - common opengl 'renderers'
       - move to Windsor as DI container (abstract out DI functions)

Gnomebulb - SDL port, video and audio 
          - more binding types
          - List Item 'templating' by resolving 'widgets' from DI container based on bound type, then packing into VBox

Winbulb - reimpliment using common UI components
